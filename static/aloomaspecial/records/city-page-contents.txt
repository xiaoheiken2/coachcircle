 Electrical Panel Upgrades<h2>

Upgrading your electrical panel is a crucial investment that offers numerous benefits in terms of safety, efficiency, and future-proofing your home or business. As electrical demands continue to rise with the addition of new appliances, devices, and technologies, an outdated electrical panel can pose significant risks and limitations.

One of the primary reasons to consider an electrical panel upgrade is safety. Older panels may not comply with current electrical codes and standards, increasing the risk of electrical fires, shocks, and other hazards. By upgrading to a modern panel, you can ensure that your electrical system meets the latest safety requirements, providing peace of mind for you and your family or employees.

Additionally, an electrical panel upgrade can improve the efficiency of your electrical system. Newer panels are designed to handle higher electrical loads, reducing the strain on your system and potentially lowering your energy costs. This is particularly important if you plan to install energy-efficient appliances, solar panels, or electric vehicle charging stations, which can place additional demands on your electrical system.

Another advantage of upgrading your electrical panel is the flexibility it provides for future expansions or renovations. New houses are standard with 200A panels these days, and it is good to have for adding circuits, such as EV chargers for cars. By upgrading to a larger panel, you can easily accommodate new circuits and avoid costly upgrades down the line. It provides flexibility for future expansions, renovations, or additional electrification projects, possibly saving you from costly upgrades down the line.

 Surge Protection and GFCI Installation<h2>

Protecting your home's electrical system and appliances is crucial for safety and longevity. Wattworks Electricals offers professional installation of surge protectors and ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) outlets to safeguard your property.

Surge protectors act as a barrier against power surges and voltage spikes, which can damage sensitive electronics like computers, televisions, and household appliances. These surges can occur due to lightning strikes, power grid fluctuations, or even the cycling of large appliances. By installing surge protectors, you can prevent costly repairs or replacements caused by electrical surges.

GFCI outlets are designed to protect against electrical shocks by quickly cutting off power when a ground fault is detected. These outlets are essential in areas with moisture, such as bathrooms, kitchens, and outdoor spaces. By installing GFCI outlets, you can significantly reduce the risk of electrical shocks and potential fires caused by short circuits.

Our team of experienced electricians ensures proper installation and testing of surge protectors and GFCI outlets, providing you with peace of mind and a safer electrical environment for your home or business.
